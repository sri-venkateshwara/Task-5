In JavaScript, `window`, `screen`, and `document` are three different objects that are part of the browser environment. 
Here's a brief explanation of each object and their differences:

1. `window`: The `window` object represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page.
 It is the global object in a browser environment and provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser window. 
The `window` object is the top-level object and acts as the global scope for JavaScript in the browser. It includes properties such as `window.innerWidth`, `window.innerHeight`, `window.location`, and methods like `window.alert()` and `window.open()`. 

2. `screen`: The `screen` object represents the user's screen or display.
 It provides information about the user's screen size, color depth, and other screen-related properties. 
Some commonly used properties of the `screen` object include `screen.width`, `screen.height`, `screen.availWidth`, and `screen.availHeight`. 
These properties can be used to determine the available screen space and adjust the layout or behavior of web content accordingly.

3. `document`: The `document` object represents the HTML document that is currently loaded in the browser window. 
It provides access to the content of the web page and allows manipulation of the HTML structure, styling, and dynamic behavior through JavaScript.
 The `document` object offers methods and properties to interact with elements in the HTML document, such as `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, `document.createElement()`,
 and many more. It allows you to modify the DOM (Document Object Model) structure, handle events, change styles, and update content dynamically.

In summary, the `window` object represents the browser window or tab, the `screen` object represents the user's screen, 
and the `document` object represents the loaded HTML document. 
Each object serves a different purpose and provides different functionalities to interact with the browser environment and manipulate web content
